# SniperBot (Spongiper)

We all know the moment when someone deletes a message and you couldn't quite read it.
That Moment now ends, with SPONGIPER you can Recover the last deleted message in any channel!

Just with the simple message of `s` Spongiper will give you the message that was deleted.

Spongiper even does temporarily save images that were deleted with the last message.

Spongiper also includes the functionality to make something into a "Quote", just reply to the message you want to be a quote and mention Spongiper!

**Spongiper has you covered on never loosing any message.**
